# "Ace" hud
Re-edit of Hudas Iscariote with several modifications for Team Fortress 2. Original edit by Mangachu.

Edit the hudlayout.res to your liking. The Fog crosshair "2" is enabled by default, so make sure to use crosshair 0 in TF2. There is currently very little customizability due to this project being a personal HUD. 

The included scoreboards are:
* 16v16 for pubs 
* 9v9 for minmode 1

Included crosshairs:

* Rainbow_Konr wings
* Quartz Crosshairs
* Fog Crosshairs
* Garm3n crosshairs

This HUD is intended for 1920x1080. Your results may vary for other resolutions.
